# ChessRobot

This is the official Slome Chess Robot!
I made this robot with pure Javascript run locally!

This project started as a small side-project to practise my JavaScript skills, chess programming ended up being quite the rabbit hole!
If you are interested in some high level JavaScript Check out the project!

(I made this with no tutorials lol)
