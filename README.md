# ChessRobot

This was my first chess robot, I have made way stronger ones since :).<br>
Still proud of what I did, but it's not my strongest bot.

## Old README (pre-26/06/2025)

This is one of my most advanced JavaScript projects, I'm still really happy how it turned out. <br>

If you want to try and beat it, check it out at https://sebastiaanheins.nl/chess <br>

The old readme was pretty bad, and the code quality is not the best. But still, the theory and algorithms within this are pretty nice.


## Older README (pre-19/10/2024)

This is the official Slome Chess Robot!
I made this robot with pure Javascript and it runs locally!

This project started as a small side-project to practise my JavaScript skills, chess programming ended up being quite the rabbit hole!
If you are interested in some high level JavaScript check out the project!

(I made this with no tutorials lol)
